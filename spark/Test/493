Okay, here's what to do.   Get a drill and a sanding disk. Use, say a 
100 disk and go at it at a very low rpm.  If you don't have a drill, try
coarse steel wool and brake fluid.  Dot 4 has an uncanny knack for removing
_any_ paint imperfections.

Oh, I'm not responsible for misuse or miapplication of either of these
techniques.
